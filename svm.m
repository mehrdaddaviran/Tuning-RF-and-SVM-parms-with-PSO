% SVM function
function fitness = svm(X,Y,C,gamma, K_fold)
    % Train an SVM model using K-fold cross-validation
    svm_model = fitcsvm(X,Y,'KernelFunction','rbf','BoxConstraint',C,'KernelScale',gamma,'Standardize',true,'KFold',K_fold);
    % Compute the cross-validation loss
    loss = kfoldLoss(svm_model);
    % Compute the fitness as the complement of the cross-validation accuracy
    fitness = 1 - (1 - loss);
